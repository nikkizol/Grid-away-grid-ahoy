# Grid-away-grid-ahoy
## The Mission:
* Recreate the layout below (use whatever text and images you want), just respect the layout
* Try to get as close as possible without writing CSS
* Add a navigation sidebar to the left, with some dummy links in them
* Style the navigation bar using only the framework you selected
* Make the grid responsive and on mobile screens (< 768px) make sure the sidenav disappears completely.
* When you move with your mouse over the "learn more" button, show a tooltip with some extra text. You can use the bootstrap tooltips for this.
* Publish your result
